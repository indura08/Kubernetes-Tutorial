Q: so again about cluster and node , tell me if I'm right or wrong? cluster is the bigger on and node is one level below that because there are nodes inside the cluster? right?

A: 

âœ… YES! You're absolutely right! ðŸŽ‰

Here's a clearer breakdown to confirm your understanding:


ðŸ§  Basic Structure of Kubernetes:

Cluster = The whole system â€” a group of machines (real or virtual) working together to run your apps.

Node = One of the machines inside that cluster â€” it could be:

A physical server

A VM

A container (like Minikube on your PC)

So:

ðŸ”¹ Cluster = group of nodes
ðŸ”¹ Node = a worker inside the cluster


ðŸ“¦ Visual Example:

Kubernetes Cluster
â”œâ”€â”€ Node 1 (Master/Control Plane)
â”œâ”€â”€ Node 2 (Worker)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Pod A
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Pod B
â”œâ”€â”€ Node 3 (Worker)
    â””â”€â”€ Pod C
    â””â”€â”€ Pod D


Each Node runs Pods (your actual apps).

One of the nodes is usually the control plane (it manages everything).

The rest are worker nodes, running your containers (via Pods).
