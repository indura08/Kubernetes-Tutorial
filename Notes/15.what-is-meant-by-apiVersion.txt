üîç apiVersion: apps/v1
-------------------------

This line tells Kubernetes which version of the Kubernetes API to use for this object.

apps/v1 means:

You're using the apps API group.

You're using version v1 of that API group.

In Kubernetes, different types of objects (like Deployment, Service, Pod, etc.) are handled by different API groups and versions, and apiVersion ensures Kubernetes knows how to process the definition you're writing.

üì¶ Why is apps/v1 used for a Deployment?
--------------------------------------------

Deployment is a workload controller, meaning it manages Pods and their lifecycle.

As of Kubernetes v1.9+, the Deployment object is part of the apps API group and stable in version v1.

So the proper and modern way to define a Deployment is:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment


Older Kubernetes versions might have used:

extensions/v1beta1 (deprecated)

apps/v1beta1 (also deprecated)

But you should always use apps/v1 now unless you're working with ancient Kubernetes versions from the Jurassic era. ü¶ñ


üö¶ Why does this matter?
--------------------------

If you use the wrong or unsupported apiVersion, Kubernetes will reject your file.

It helps Kubernetes know how to validate and interpret the structure of the object.

üí° Simple analogy

Imagine you hand in a form to the government.

apiVersion is like saying: ‚ÄúThis is Form 1040 from the 2023 tax year.‚Äù

Without that, the clerk (Kubernetes) won‚Äôt know how to read your form correctly and might throw it out.

API Versions more simplified
_____________________________

‚úÖ What is apiVersion in Kubernetes?

In Kubernetes, every YAML configuration file defines a type of object ‚Äî like a Deployment, Service, Pod, etc.
But Kubernetes is made up of many different APIs (like apps, networking, storage), and each API evolves over time with different versions (like v1, v1beta1, etc.).

So:

apiVersion tells Kubernetes **which version of the API** to use to create or manage the resource you‚Äôre defining.

It's like saying:

‚ÄúHey K8s, I‚Äôm giving you a Deployment, and I want you to use the API group apps, version v1, to handle it.‚Äù

üöÄ Now, let‚Äôs look at common apiVersions
------------------------------------------

1. v1 ‚Äì Core API Group

Used for: Pod, Service, ConfigMap, Secret, PersistentVolume, etc.

Why: These are core resources ‚Äî the foundation of Kubernetes ‚Äî and they‚Äôre stable.

No group name is specified because it‚Äôs part of the core API group.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
...


2. apps/v1 ‚Äì API Group for Deployments, StatefulSets, etc.

Used for: Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, ReplicaSet

Group name: apps

Version: v1 (stable version)

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
...


‚úÖ This group was created because managing workloads (replicas, rolling updates, etc.) is more complex, so they‚Äôre organized under the apps group.


3. networking.k8s.io/v1 ‚Äì API Group for Networking

Used for: Ingress, NetworkPolicy

Group name: networking.k8s.io

Version: v1 (stable version)

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
...

üì° This group handles how traffic flows in and out of your cluster, and how pods talk to each other securely.


| apiVersion             | What it's for        | Examples                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `v1`                   | Core K8s resources   | `Pod`, `Service`, `ConfigMap` |
| `apps/v1`              | Workload controllers | `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`   |
| `networking.k8s.io/v1` | Networking resources | `Ingress`, `NetworkPolicy`    |




so this raise a good question

‚úÖ What are Kubernetes APIs?
------------------------------
Kubernetes is built entirely around APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).
These APIs define what kinds of objects you can create (like Pods, Services, Deployments), and how to interact with them (create, update, delete, etc.).

Think of it like this:

üß± The Kubernetes API is like a menu in a restaurant. It tells you what you can order (resource types) and how to order them (the API version and fields).

üéØ What Does a Kubernetes API Do?
====================================

Let‚Äôs say you want to create a Deployment to run your Angular app. You write a YAML file like this:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
...

When you run kubectl apply -f my-deployment.yaml, Kubernetes:

	1. Reads the apiVersion to figure out which API group and version to use (apps/v1 in this case).

	2. Reads the kind to know what type of resource you want (Deployment).

	3. Uses the Kubernetes API server to create that resource.


üß© Kubernetes APIs Are Organized by:

1. Group ‚Äì Groups of similar resources
Examples:

core (no prefix, used by v1)

apps (used for workloads like Deployments)

batch (for Jobs, CronJobs)

networking.k8s.io (for Ingress, NetworkPolicy)

2. Version ‚Äì Indicates how stable or mature the API is

Examples:

v1 = stable

v1beta1 = testing/new features


‚úÖ Examples of Kubernetes APIs
---------------------------------


| Resource Kind | API Group                 | Version | apiVersion used in YAML        |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| Pod           | core                      | v1      | `v1`                           |
| Deployment    | apps                      | v1      | `apps/v1`                      |
| Ingress       | networking.k8s.io         | v1      | `networking.k8s.io/v1`         |
| Job           | batch                     | v1      | `batch/v1`                     |
| Role          | rbac.authorization.k8s.io | v1      | `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1` |


finally:

Kubernetes is built using multiple APIs, and each API group exposes specific Kubernetes objects like Pod, Service, Deployment, Ingress, etc.
That's why we specify apiVersion and kind at the beginning of a Kubernetes YAML file ‚Äî to tell Kubernetes which API group and which type of object we're defining.
