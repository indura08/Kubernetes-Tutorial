🔹 What is YAML?

YAML stands for:

YAML Ain’t Markup Language (yes, it’s a recursive joke)

It's a human-friendly data format used for:

Configuration files

Data exchange between systems

Defining structured data (like Kubernetes objects)

It’s an alternative to JSON and XML but is more readable and cleaner, especially for nested data.


🔸 Why Does Kubernetes Use YAML?

Kubernetes needs to know how to create, manage, and update things like:

Pods

Deployments

Services

ConfigMaps

Ingress

...and more

YAML is used to describe the desired state of these resources.

Think of YAML like the blueprint you give Kubernetes. You’re saying:

“Here, make sure my app is always running this way, with these specs.”

🧠 YAML Fundamentals (Deep Dive)
---------------------------------

✅ 1. Key-Value Pairs

name: angular-frontend
replicas: 3

✅ 2. Indentation = Structure (No curly braces {}!)

metadata:
  name: my-app
  labels:
    app: frontend

Indentation defines hierarchy, just like nested objects. Always use 2 spaces per level. NO TABS!

✅ 3. Lists

containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image:latest
  - name: sidecar
    image: logging-image

- means it’s a list item. Each list item can have its own nested structure.

✅ 4. Types

YAML auto-detects data types:

string: "hello"
integer: 123
boolean: true
list:
  - item1
  - item2
null_value: null

✅ 5. Comments

# This is a comment in YAML
replicas: 2  # inline comment


so what is this 

metadata:
  name: angular-frontend-deployment
  labels:
    app: angular-frontend

This is not a list — it’s a nested structure of key-value pairs (also called a map or dictionary, similar to a JSON object).


🔍 Let’s analyze it line by line:

metadata:
This is a key.

The value under it is an indented block of more key-value pairs. That’s what makes it nested.

name: angular-frontend-deployment
Inside metadata, there is a key name with a string value.

This sets the name of the Kubernetes object (e.g., the Deployment).

labels:
Another key under metadata.

Its value is another nested block (also not a list!).

app: angular-frontend
This is a label — a key-value pair under labels.


so , In JSON, it would look like:

{
  "metadata": {
    "name": "angular-frontend-deployment",
    "labels": {
      "app": "angular-frontend"
    }
  }
}
